# CA-Design-CPU

This was a project which we had to do in one of our university courses named computer architecture. 
It's the schematic quartus files of a simple CPU which works with a memory and a simple ROM. At first, we should design a CPU which works 
only with a memory and it should read memory lines which were some command lines for CPU and you can see them in "ISA.pdf" file. then, we 
should change our design and add a ROM to it, and some new types of command lines added, which were written in the ROM and the CPU should
read command lines from ROM and convert them to some previous ISA and run them.
